In Python, functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They allow you to break down your program into smaller, modular pieces, making your code more organized, readable, and easier to maintain. Functions also promote code reusability, as you can call them multiple times from different parts of your program.

Here's a basic syntax for defining a function in Python:

## Syntax
def function_name(parameters):
    # Function body
    # Perform some operations
    return result

    def: This keyword is used to define a function.
    function_name: This is the name of the function.
    parameters: These are optional. They represent the inputs that the function accepts. You can have zero or more parameters.
    return: This keyword is used to return a value from the function. A function may or may not return a value.
function_name(something) # calling the function with the function name.
parameter is the name of the variable, the actual value of data is an argument.

## Positional vs Keyword argument

In Python, positional arguments are the most common type of arguments passed to functions. They are defined by their position in the function call, meaning the order in which they are passed determines which parameter they correspond to in the function definition.
# Function definition
def greet(name, age):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

# This will raise a TypeError because the 'age' parameter doesn't have a default value
greet("Alice",30)

In Python, keyword arguments are arguments passed to a function using the name of the parameter as a keyword. This allows you to specify arguments out of order and provides clarity to the function call by explicitly stating which argument corresponds to which parameter.
# Function definition
def greet(name, age):
    print(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")

# This will raise a TypeError because the 'age' parameter doesn't have a default value
greet(age=30, name="Alice")
