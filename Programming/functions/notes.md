Functions in Python are blocks of organized, reusable code that perform a specific task. They allow you to break down your program into smaller, manageable pieces, making your code more modular and easier to understand. Here's a basic overview of how functions work in Python:

    Defining a Function:

    To define a function in Python, you use the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. If the function takes parameters, you list them inside the parentheses. The function definition ends with a colon, and the code block that defines what the function does is indented beneath it.

## Syntax


def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")

Calling a Function:

Once a function is defined, you can call it by using its name followed by parentheses. If the function takes parameters, you pass the values inside the parentheses.

## Syntax

greet("Alice")

Return Statement:

Functions can optionally return a value using the return statement. This allows the function to send a result back to the caller.

## Syntax

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8

In Python, a while loop allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. Here's a basic overview of how while loops work:

## Syntax:

while condition:
    # code block to execute

The loop begins with the while keyword, followed by a condition. If the condition evaluates to True, the code block inside the loop is executed. This process continues until the condition becomes False.

Example:

# Count from 1 to 5 using a while loop
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

Output:

1
2
3
4
5

Infinite Loop:

Be cautious when using while loops to avoid creating infinite loops, where the condition always evaluates to True. This can cause your program to hang or become unresponsive. Make sure the condition eventually becomes False to exit the loop.

# Infinite loop
while True:
    print("This is an infinite loop")

To break out of an infinite loop, you can use break statement.

Break and Continue:

Inside a while loop, you can use break to exit the loop prematurely, even if the loop condition is still True. You can also use continue to skip the rest of the loop's code block and continue to the next iteration.

# Exit loop when count reaches 3
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    if count == 3:
        break
    print(count)
    count += 1

Output:

1
2

Else Clause:

Similar to for loops, while loops in Python can have an optional else clause that is executed when the loop condition becomes False.

## syntax

count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
else:
    print("Loop ended")

Output:

    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    Loop ended

These are some of the basic concepts of while loops in Python. They are useful for situations where you need to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met.
